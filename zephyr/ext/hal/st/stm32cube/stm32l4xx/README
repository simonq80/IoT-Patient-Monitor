Patch List:
===========

*Current implementation of LL_SPI_TransmitData16 on F3/F7/L4 family
  generates following warning:
  "warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing
  rules [-Wstrict-aliasing]"
  Besides being forbidden by rule, this cast is not needed, as register is
  16 bits wide. Modification has been tested on L4 SoC.
  stm32yyxx_ll_spi.h being included in soc.h file, warning is generated
  at each compiled object, this commit allows a clean build.
Impacted files:
