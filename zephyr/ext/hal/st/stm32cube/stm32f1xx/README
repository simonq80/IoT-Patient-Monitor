The current version supported in Zephyr for STM32F1 Cube is V1.6.0



Patch List:
===========

*Disable i2c HAL
   Due to conflict with zephyr i2c.h (I2C_SPEED_STANDARD and I2C_SPEED_FAST
   redefinition), deactivate STM32Cube I2C HAL. This raises no issue since
   LL API is currently used for stm32 I2C driver.
Impacted files:
   drivers/include/stm32f1xx_hal_conf.h
ST Bug tracker ID: NA. Not a stm32cube issue

*Update LSI_VALUE to 40 KHz
Impacted files:
  drivers/include/stm32f1xx_ll_rcc.h
ST Bug tracker ID: 37419
